personal-trading-terminal

This terminal let's you trade on Binance USDT-Futures with the API. Just make an .env file including your API keys and you're good to go.

Also shows top news from TreeNews. (with 5 second delay because it's not a paid version)

might try to add telegram support just like I did with [text](https://github.com/goktugoner23/telegram-binance-futures-bot)
