personal-trading-terminal

This terminal let's you trade on Binance USDT-Futures with the API. Just make an .env file including your API keys and you're good to go.

e.g write "btcusdt", "ethusdt" to the coin textbox, write size in amount textbox e.g 0.1, 0.01, 2345. The terminal trades in coin size, not amount of USDT.

Also shows top news from TreeNews. (with 5 second delay because it's not a paid version)

might try to add telegram support just like I did with my [telegram-binance-futures-bot](https://github.com/goktugoner23/telegram-binance-futures-bot)
